    "# Comparison with Relational Databases [<sup>3</sup>](#whygraphdb)\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare Neo4j and Cypher with traditional relational databases, we will explore the advantages and drawbacks of using a graph-based approach over a tabular one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Neo4j and cypher over relational SQL [<sup>4</sup>](#neo4jVSsql) [<sup>5</sup>](#diffgraphandrelationaldb)\n",
    "One of the main advantages of Neo4j and its query language, Cypher, is that data is stored in a **graph structure** composed of nodes and relationships rather than in tables. This allows for the efficient traversal of relationships between entities. In Neo4j, navigating from one node to another via a relationship can be done in constant time, regardless of the graph's size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, relational databases require joins between tables to establish relationships, which can become computationally expensive—especially as the number of joins increases or when dealing with deep or complex relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly true for relationship-heavy queries, where SQL databases often need to create recursive views or perform iterative joins to explore multi-level relationships. In contrast, Neo4j can efficiently leverage its graph-native structure to maintain **linear performance** relative to the number of hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key advantage of Neo4j and Cypher is the **simplicity** and **readability** of queries when working with graph data. \n",
    "For example, if we want to find the names of people who are friends with someone named Alice, we can write the following Cypher query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(:Person {name: 'Alice'})\n",
    "RETURN p.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational SQL, achieving the same result would require:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p1.name\n",
    "FROM Person p1\n",
    "JOIN Friendship f ON p1.id = f.person_id\n",
    "JOIN Person p2 ON f.friend_id = p2.id\n",
    "WHERE p2.name = 'Alice';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, relationship queries are significantly more intuitive in Cypher. \n",
    "The graph pattern-matching syntax closely reflects the actual structure of the data, making queries easier to write, read, and reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third advantage of Neo4j is its **schema-free data model**. In Neo4j, we are not required to define all possible relationships or properties for each node type in advance. This allows the data model to handle irregular or evolving data naturally, offering greater flexibility as your application and data grow over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, SQL databases rely on rigid schemas, where structural modifications often require **schema migrations**, making them less adaptable to dynamic or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as you will see throughout this tutorial, Neo4j is both well-suited and optimized for implementing graph algorithms. By using in-memory graph projections, we can efficiently run algorithms to uncover patterns such as communities, influence, shortest paths, and more. This makes Neo4j not just a data store, but a powerful analytical tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of Neo4j and cypher over relational SQL [<sup>6</sup>](#graphdbscalelimitation)\n",
    "Interestingly, some of Neo4j’s strengths can also become limitations depending on the use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transactional Workloads**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If your data is **highly structured** and the focus is on **transactions** rather than relationships, Neo4j may be less efficient than relational databases. Traditional SQL databases typically perform better for workflows centered around aggregations, batch updates, or structured reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Data Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Neo4j is not ideal for real-time analysis on rapidly changing data. As you will see in this tutorial, running graph algorithms often requires creating **in-memory projections**, which work best with relatively stable snapshots of the data rather than constantly updating streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Higher Memory Overhead**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, graph databases tend to have a higher memory overhead compared to relational SQL databases. This is due to how they store nodes and relationships in memory to enable **fast traversal**, which can increase resource usage—especially for large-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any decision involving database management systems, it's important to carefully analyze your **use cases** before choosing the right tool. Neo4j excels in certain scenarios, but may not be the best fit for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple roadmap of requirements that might indicate Neo4j is a good choice includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unstructured or evolving data**: When the data model is flexible and may change over time.\n",
    "- **Relationship-focused queries**: When your workload involves exploring or analyzing relationships and traversals (e.g., social networks, recommendations, graphs of dependencies).\n",
    "- **Stable datasets or snapshot-based analysis**: When the data is relatively stable, or when it's acceptable to analyze it using periodic snapshots rather than in real-time.\n"

   "source": [
    "## Common applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j (and graph databases in general) are commonly used in a variety of fields where data is highly interconnected. These applications are particularly well-suited for graph databases because of their ability to efficiently manage and query complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Knowledge graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A **knowledge graph** is a data model which represents information as a network of entities (nodes) and the relationships between them (edges). It is used to make complex data more manageable and easier to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Neo4j, building knowledge graphs becomes more intuitive, as real-world relationships are naturally mapped to the graph structure. The graph is also fast to code, requiring few lines of code, and quick to update due to its flexible data schema.\n",
    "Additionaly, users can use tools like [Neo4j's Knowledge Graph Builder](https://neo4j.com/labs/genai-ecosystem/llm-graph-builder/) to quickly build knowledge graphs from their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Artificial Intelligences (such as large language models) often struggle with reasoning. The structured nature of knowledge graphs powered by **Neo4j** allows these AIs to access relevant contextual data more efficiently. Therefore, AI-generated responses become more accurate, as they are based in truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating user preferences and histories——which can be easily integrated into the knowledge graphs——AIs are also able to generate more personalized responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (paper): [The Growing Importance of Graph Databases for AI](https://media.bitpipe.com/io_31x/io_316186/item_2812073/ESG-WP-AWS-Neptune-Jun-2024.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "When committing bank fraud, fraudsters often operate in rings, which are highly connected networks. Graph databases make fraud-pattern recognition more efficient than SQL databases since the relationships between transactions and individuals can be transposed to a graph, which can then be analyzed to detect suspicious activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (paper): [Enhancing fraud detection in banking by integration of graph databases with machine learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016124001377).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Identity & Access management\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases can be useful for managing roles and access to data sets because they naturally represent relationships—such as user-role or role-permission links—as edges. This model can make it easier to visualize and traverse access control structures. While Cypher provides a flexible way to query and modify these relationships, implementing a robust and secure access control system still requires careful design. For example, performance, consistency, and complexity can become challenges in large-scale or highly dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (paper): [Comparison of Access Control Approaches for Graph-Structured Data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381109230_Comparison_of_Access_Control_Approaches_for_Graph-Structured_Data/link/665d6e1dbc86444c7229431a/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Master data management\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j offers a master data management service that allows to unify your data into a single \"*360° view*\" of your data. This means that, for example, data related to customer, product, supplier, and logistics information can be put together in order to leverage insights across datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example (white paper): [Rethink Your Master Data - How Connections Will Define the Future of MDM](https://go.neo4j.com/rs/710-RRC-335/images/Neo4j-Master-Data-Management-white-paper-EN-US.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Network and IT operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are ideal for integrating network and IT assets to help with troubleshooting and analyzing networks. By using a graph database, connections between different monitoring tools is possible, allowing users to improve the management of their networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (white paper): [How Graph Databases Solve Problems in Network & Data Center Management: a Close Look at Two Deployments](https://we-yun.com/doc/neo4j-book/%E5%9B%BE%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93%E4%BA%94%E5%A4%A7%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E6%A1%88%E4%BE%8B/EMA_Neo4j_Two_Deployments-WP.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Real-time recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of editing, traversing, and extracting data from graph databases is unmatched by other databases types, enabling real-time recommendation processing. Additionally, since graph databases efficiently handle complex and deep relationships between entities, they make recommendations like \"People who bought this also bought...\" possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example (white paper): [Powering Real-Time Recommendations with Graph Database Technology](https://go.neo4j.com/rs/710-RRC-335/images/Neo4j_WP_Recommendations_EN_BUS.pdf?_ga=2.216021586.597232194.1522833081-1282627512.1522833081)\n",

    "- Where and when personal data moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regulations of different countries (such as the [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)) are also tackled, but the GDPR is more relevant in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Supply chain management\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply chains are complex networks, making graph databases particularly well-suited for managing them. With graph databases, it is then possible to anticipate shifts in demand, predict product handling costs, and adapt to new compliance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (paper): [Graph Database to Enhance Supply Chain Resilience for Industry 4.0](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88cf/a5f142b2656090010fdc212260e03098a6f2.pdf)\n",

    "Throughout this tutorial, we explored Neo4j's capabilities and learned several key lessons. We started by loading data from a **JSON file**, demonstrating how Neo4j can easily integrate with simple data formats and transform structured data into a graph representation. Neo4j's storage of data as nodes and relationships proved ideal for representing our startup ecosystem, while Cypher provided intuitive syntax for creating and querying the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation of **PageRank** revealed influential nodes in our startup network, showing how companies like *Tesla* and *Lucid Motors* gain influence through their investor connections. The **Louvain algorithm** helped detect natural communities, demonstrating how startups group around similar technologies and investors. **Cross-analysis** of both algorithms showed how a node's influence often correlates with its community structure, highlighting the ability to perform **statistical analysis** using graph databases.\n",
