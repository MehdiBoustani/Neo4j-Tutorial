    "Nowadays, traditional databases often struggle with highly connected data, leading to slow and complex queries. Neo4j, a graph database released in 2007, solves this problem by storing data as nodes and relationships instead of tables. This approach makes it faster and easier to explore connections between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j is widely used in areas like social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs—where relationships matter most. In this tutorial, we will explore its capabilities by analyzing a startup ecosystem, fetching data from a JSON file, using Cypher queries, PageRank, and Louvain community detection to uncover key insights."

    "# Comparison with Relational Databases \n",
    "\n",
    "To compare Neo4j and Cypher with traditional relational databases, we will explore the advantages and drawbacks of using a graph-based approach over a tabular one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Neo4j and cypher over relational SQL\n",
    "One of the main advantages of Neo4j and its query language, Cypher, is that data is stored in a graph structure composed of nodes and relationships rather than in tables. This allows for the efficient traversal of relationships between entities. In Neo4j, navigating from one node to another via a relationship can be done in constant time, regardless of the graph's size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, relational databases require joins between tables to establish relationships, which can become computationally expensive—especially as the number of joins increases or when dealing with deep or complex relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly true for relationship-heavy queries, where SQL databases often need to create recursive views or perform iterative joins to explore multi-level relationships. In contrast, Neo4j can efficiently leverage its graph-native structure to maintain **linear performance** relative to the number of hops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key advantage of Neo4j and Cypher is the **simplicity** and **readability** of queries when working with graph data. \n",
    "For example, if we want to find the names of people who are friends with someone named Alice, we can write the following Cypher query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(:Person {name: 'Alice'})\n",
    "RETURN p.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational SQL, achieving the same result would require:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p1.name\n",
    "FROM Person p1\n",
    "JOIN Friendship f ON p1.id = f.person_id\n",
    "JOIN Person p2 ON f.friend_id = p2.id\n",
    "WHERE p2.name = 'Alice';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, relationship queries are significantly more intuitive in Cypher. \n",
    "The graph pattern-matching syntax closely reflects the actual structure of the data, making queries easier to write, read, and reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third advantage of Neo4j is its **schema-free data model**. In Neo4j, we are not required to define all possible relationships or properties for each node type in advance. This allows the data model to handle irregular or evolving data naturally, offering greater flexibility as your application and data grow over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, SQL databases rely on rigid schemas, where structural modifications often require **schema migrations**, making them less adaptable to dynamic or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as you will see throughout this tutorial, Neo4j is both well-suited and optimized for implementing graph algorithms. By using in-memory graph projections, we can efficiently run algorithms to uncover patterns such as communities, influence, shortest paths, and more. This makes Neo4j not just a data store, but a powerful analytical tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of Neo4j and cypher over relational SQL\n",
    "Interestingly, some of Neo4j’s strengths can also become limitations depending on the use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transactional Workloads**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If your data is **highly structured** and the focus is on **transactions** rather than relationships, Neo4j may be less efficient than relational databases. Traditional SQL databases typically perform better for workflows centered around aggregations, batch updates, or structured reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Data Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Neo4j is not ideal for real-time analysis on rapidly changing data. As you will see in this tutorial, running graph algorithms often requires creating **in-memory projections**, which work best with relatively stable snapshots of the data rather than constantly updating streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Higher Memory Overhead**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, graph databases tend to have a higher memory overhead compared to relational SQL databases. This is due to how they store nodes and relationships in memory to enable **fast traversal**, which can increase resource usage—especially for large-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any decision involving database management systems, it's important to carefully analyze your **use cases** before choosing the right tool. Neo4j excels in certain scenarios, but may not be the best fit for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple roadmap of requirements that might indicate Neo4j is a good choice includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unstructured or evolving data**: When the data model is flexible and may change over time.\n",
    "- **Relationship-focused queries**: When your workload involves exploring or analyzing relationships and traversals (e.g., social networks, recommendations, graphs of dependencies).\n",
    "- **Stable datasets or snapshot-based analysis**: When the data is relatively stable, or when it's acceptable to analyze it using periodic snapshots rather than in real-time.\n"

    "## Common applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j (or more broadly: graph databases) are commonly used in the following fields.\n",
    "Many of these applications are well-suited for Neo4j because they involve highly connected data, which graph databases handle efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Knowledge graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Neo4j, building knowledge graphs becomes easy since the real-world relationships are translated into data models in a straightforward way. The graph is also fast to code, requiring few lines of code, and quick to update due to its flexible data schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AIs (such as large language models) struggle with reasoning. Knowledge graphs using Neo4j allow to overcome this by storing relevant and contextual data more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Fraud detection & analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since fraudsters operate in rings, graph databases make fraud-pattern recognition more efficient than SQL databases. The relationships between transactions and individuals can be transposed to a graph that can then be analyzed to detect suspicious activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Identity & access management\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing roles and accesses to different sets of data is easily done using graph databases since relationships between entities are represented as graph edges, which are easily added or removed using the Cypher query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Master data management\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j offers a master data management service that allows to unify your data into a single \"*360° view*\" of your data. This means that data related to customer, product, supplier, and logistics information can be put together in order to leverage insights across datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Network and IT operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are ideal for correlating network and IT assets to help with troubleshooting or analyzing networks. By using this kind of databases, a connection between different monitoring tools is possible, allowing users to better manage their networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Real-time recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of graph databases is unmatched by other types of databases, allowing real-time recommendations processing to be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Data privacy, risk and compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j's [*Privacy Shield*](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/gdpr-compliance/?ref=web-solutions-privacy-risk-compliance) enables companies to comply with the EU's [General Data Protection Requirements (GDPR)](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/data-protection/data-protection-gdpr/index_en.htm), which requires companies to control and manage customer data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It connects personal data and tracks:\n",
    "- The location of private information;\n",
    "- Which systems and apps use the data;\n",
    "- How and when personal data is used;\n",
    "- Who looks at and uses the data;\n",
    "- What permissions you have to use the data, and when and how they were obtained;\n",
    "- Where and where personal data moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different countries' regulation (such as the [California Consumer Privacy Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)) are also tackled, but the GDPR is more relevant for our use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Supply chain management\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply chains can be efficiently represented as graphs, making graph databases particularly well-suited for handling them. When using graph databases, it is then possible to anticipate shifts in demand, predict product handling cost, and adapt to new compliance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Industry use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Many industry uses of Neo4j are a combination of the common uses mentioned previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Industries use Neo4j for the following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Financial services\n",
    "    - Detect fraud rings; \n",
